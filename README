Boggle like game.
Easy usage: python boggle.py

More complex usage: python boggle.py <paramfilename>

paramfile contains an eval-friendly dict containing

{
"data": <data or seed>,
"x": <number of columns>,
"y": <number of rows>,
"wordfile": <path to word list>,
}

e.g., 

{
"data": "_random",
"x": 4,
"y": 4,
"wordfile": "Dicts/words.txt"
}

there is optionally a fifth key, "scrabble", which implements a bag of tiles, each with an alphabetic character.

please use lowercase only

e.g.

{
"data": "_random",
"x": 4,
"y": 4,
"wordfile": "Dicts/words.txt",
"scrabble": "bbbbbbbaaaaaaaoooooooklmn"
}

This will create a matrix mostly of "b"s, "o"s and "a"s.
